## **Why WASM Java Agents?**

This Blueprint bridges the gap between powerful WebAssembly agents and enterprise Java applications. By running WebAssembly modules within the JVM, you get:

**🏢 Enterprise Ready:** Leverage the JVM's platform independence, robust memory management, and security model for production deployments.

**⚡ High Performance:** Combine WebAssembly's near-native performance with Java's optimized runtime and garbage collection.

**🛠️ Multi-Language Ecosystem:** Run agents written in Rust, Go, Python, and JavaScript seamlessly within a single Java application.

**🔒 Production Grade:** Built on Quarkus for cloud-native deployment with fast startup times and low memory footprint.

**🚀 Scalable Architecture:** Deploy AI agents at enterprise scale with the reliability and maturity of the Java platform.

Whether you're building enterprise AI applications, integrating existing WebAssembly modules into Java systems, or exploring multi-language agent architectures, this Blueprint provides a solid foundation for JVM-based AI agent development.
